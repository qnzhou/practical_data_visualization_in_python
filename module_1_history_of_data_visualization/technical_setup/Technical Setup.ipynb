    "# Technical Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this couse, we use the popular [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) to generate visualizations. We will write everything in [python language](https://www.python.org), and we assume you are familiar with basic python programming. We recommand to use python version 3.10 or newer. To help you get started, we also provide a step-to-step instruction to setup a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) virtual environment that contains all the python packages we will be using in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup conda\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the instructions [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) to install conda to your system. Once installed, one should be able to run the following command in a terminal without error.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create conda environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Please copy the following block of text to a file named `environment.yml` or download the file [here](https://github.com/qnzhou/practical_data_visualization_in_python/blob/master/environment.yml):\n",
    "```\n",
    "name: data_visualization\n",
    "dependencies:\n",
    "  - python=3.10\n",
    "  - pip\n",
    "  - pip:\n",
    "    - numpy\n",
    "    - altair\n",
    "    - pandas\n",
    "    - vega\n",
    "    - vega-datasets\n",
    "    - jupyter\n",
    "    - pyarrow\n",
    "    - fastparquet\n",
    "    - geopandas\n",
    "    - mnist\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once done, run the following command to create a conda environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env create environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a conda environment with many packages pre-installed. In particular, `numpy`, `altair`, `pandas` and `geopandas` packages are available in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activate conda environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have created a conda environment named `data_visualization`. We need to activate it before we can use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate data_visualization\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once activate, you should be able to test the environment by trying to import of the preinstalled packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m \"import altair\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we will do all the code in the Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebook is a popular web-based interactive development for python. It is also document-centric that allows one to seamlessly integrate text with code.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `data_visualization` conda environment activated, we can now start a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook test.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will open a window/tap in your web browser that contains the web-based development setup. It will also create a Jupyter notebook file named `test.ipynb` in the current directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of the notebook are organized as a sequence of \"cells\". Each cell can either contain code or text. In code cells, you can put a block of python code and run it by clicking the run button (or shift + enter). We typically run code cells in the order from top to bottom, and variables/functions created in an earlier code cell will be available for later code cells to use. In a text cell, we can write arbitrary texts. The texts will be formatted using [markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).\n",
    "\n",
    "All the case studies and assignments are done using Jupyter notebook. It is encouraged to download the jupyter notebook for each of the case studies and run/modify the code locally on your system."
